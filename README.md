# 🔧 Python FEM Journey — By Chintan

## About
Learning Python for Computational Mechanics from scratch.
Currently preparing for M.Sc in Computational Mechanics 
at University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany (April 2026).

## Projects

### Day 1 — First Engineering Plot
Sine wave visualization using NumPy and Matplotlib.

### Day 2 — Stress Calculator
Calculates stress from force and cross-sectional area.
Formula: σ = F/A with safety warnings.

### Day 3 — Multi-Material Stress Calculator v2.0
Supports Steel, Aluminum, Titanium and Cast Iron.
Includes safety factor calculation and stress vs force plot.

### Day 4 — Bar Stiffness Calculator
Calculates axial stiffness of a bar.
Formula: k = AE/L — the foundation of FEM.

### Day 5 — 1D FEM Solver ⭐
A complete Finite Element solver for a 2-element bar.
- Assembles global stiffness matrix
- Applies boundary conditions
- Solves system of equations using NumPy
- Visualizes displacement and stress distribution
